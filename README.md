# GifTastic

This project is gif pictures generator application. When you run the program you can see some buttons on the top which have different names of food on. If you click any, application generates 10 paused gif pictures on the page. Also you would be able to see their ratings. They are all made dinamically. You can animate them by clicking on them. To pause them again, click one more time. 
Also you can generate your own food buttons by entering any food you have in mind then click submit. The button shows up in the button section on top, then if you click on it, it would function as same as the premade buttons.  

### Getting Started 

Please go to this URL: https://neginnami.github.io/GifTastic

## Prerequisites & Installing

Just a web browser would be enough to run the game. I would recommend Google Chrome. You don't need to install anything extra.
 
### Running and test

Generate buttons with different foods name. Click each button and see the results. Sometimes it takes time for pictures to become animated if you don't access to a high speed internet. Beacuse that is a heavy load of gif images. The best way to test the functionality is to wait a bit for all paused gif to be loaded. Then attemp to click on them to make them animated.
